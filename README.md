# C343Group3TourGuide

An application that allows user to select a tour to go on, loads in locations for the tour and loads in associated hotels/restaurants for each location.
Users are taken from location to location, allowing them to stay at hotel, eat at restaurants, perform unique action for each location and finally outputs how much they spent in total.


The project has been created as a visual studio project in the Tour guide app project folder.
Tour guide sql text file contains the sql to create the database.
